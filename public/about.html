<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a 22-year-old student at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering in Ni≈°, Serbia, where I'm building my foundation
   in electronics and computer science. What makes me unique is my passion for blending 
   technical knowledge with creative pursuits. While my academic focus lies in engineering, 
   I find myself drawn to various forms of art and design, always seeking ways to express creativity in everything I do.</p>

<p>During my time at university, I've discovered that learning goes far beyond textbooks and lectures.
   I enjoy exploring different aspects of technology while maintaining a keen interest in arts and design. 
  This combination allows me to approach problem-solving from multiple angles,
   often finding innovative solutions that others might overlook. My curiosity drives me to constantly learn new things, 
   whether it's the latest programming languages or discovering new artistic techniques.</p>
